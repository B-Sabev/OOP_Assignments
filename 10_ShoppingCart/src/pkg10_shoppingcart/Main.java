                water melon (price 4,50 and shipping 6,75)
                wine glasses (price 8,50 and shipping 6,75)
                washing machines (price 499 and shipping 30,00)
                    
            Add a suitable constructor to each class.
            You only have to implement one of the concrete items and payment methods. Design
            the methods as simple as possible. It is for instance sufficient for the method
            pay to print out the payment method and the total price.
