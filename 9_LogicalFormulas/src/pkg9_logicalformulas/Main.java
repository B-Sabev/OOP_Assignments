            - Add a number of static methods to your main class, each of which construct a tree
of a logic formula. Think up a few interesting cases on your own. You will use these
to test your operations
        
            - Implement PrintFormVisitor, try to use the least amount of brackets
       
            - use generics in the interfaces and adjust the classes

            - Implement an EvalFormVisitor and test it on different valuations and formulas.
        
        Bonus - make a factory for the classes
